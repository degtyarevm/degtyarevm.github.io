    <p>What I learned during the HTML activities was how to create a hyperlink by using the href tag and how to use the unordered list tag. To create a hyperlink you need to use the <a href=""></a> tag. 
      Inside the quotes, you include the link to where you want someone to direct to, and inside the carets (><) you enter the text you want the hyperlink to display. 
      To create an unordered list you need to use the unordered list tag (<ul></ul>) to specify that it is an unordered list and inside the tag include the list item tag (<li></li>) to create an item. 
      I can continue to practice coding with HTML to understand more concepts. I can also apply them to this class when working on my GitHub repository.</p>
