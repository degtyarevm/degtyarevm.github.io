    <p>For session 5, I chose activities 1 and 3 to complete. The first activity had me go over an overview of social networks. A social network is a community of individuals who come together to share different kinds of interests and thoughts.
      There are many social networks available for use, like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, and more. Some of these networks can be accessed through the web but, most are on mobile devices. Social networks can be used for a variety of reasons like marketing, job searching, news, chatting, and sharing different forms of media.
      The second activity I did was activity #3. This activity went over the Honeycomb model which is a way to review the effectiveness of specific social networks. The honeycomb model has 7 main blocks to it, identity, presence, relationships, reputation, groups, conversations, and sharing.
      Identity is the ability of a user to create a unique profile. Presence indicates displaying the activity of a user. Relationships show if a user can create connections with other users. Reputation allows the user to build credit to show trustworthiness. Groups allow users to create and join different communities.
      Conversations show if a social network allows the user to converse with other users. Sharing allows the user to send and receive various types of content. Most popular social networks have all 7 building blocks involved like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
      Others like Pinterest, and Snapchat lack in presence and groups. To summarize social networks are online communities for people to share different ideas and the honeycomb model is a way to measure the effectiveness of social networks.</p>
