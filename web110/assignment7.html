    <p>For session 7, I chose to do activities 1 and 2. These activities went over the basics of internet security. Internet security is securing communication over the Internet. Activity 1 had me read two articles that went over internet safety and how to identify security threats.
      Some tips to stay safe on the internet are to create strong passwords, familiarize yourself with your browser's security features, and avoid suspicious links. Special security protocols were created to secure communication over the Internet like Internet Security Protocol (IPSec) which creates secure packets and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) which provides security when transporting information.
      Many threats on the Internet try to steal your data. Some of these threats are malware, ransomware, and phishing. The 2nd activity had me practice browser safety by reviewing my browser settings. I first checked if my browser and its addons are up to date which they are.
      I then cleared my browser cache, history, and cookies to remove any of my data saved on the internet. I last reviewed the autoform settings to see if I have any unwanted saved information. I can apply these concepts to my environment when using the internet for school or personal use.
      Using the internet safely ensures that I don't get any of my data stolen or my system infected.</p>
