    <p>The first activity I chose was activity #1. This activity gave me an introduction to search engines and tips on how to get the best results when searching.
      Search engines are big databases made up of different internet resources like web pages, images, videos, and more.
      You can search for anything with keywords or phrases that then find the most relevant info on what you searched. Search engines have 3 main components that make it up.
      A web crawler, database, and search interface. A web crawler gathers information on the web, the database stores all of the information on the web, and search interfaces connect you with the database.
      Those 3 components work together to bring you the information you looked up. There are many search engines to choose from like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and more.
      These search engines have different interfaces and features that best fit your needs. The 2nd activity I did was activity #2. This activity had me compare search engines and the ones that I chose were Google and Bing.
      Google has a very nice clean design and doesn't have many widgets that cover the screen. When searching on Google it presents many hyperlinks that can redirect you to different websites.
      This search engine also offers different features such as image and video search for your specific search query. The other search engine I compared was Bing.
      Bing's interface has many different widgets when you open it like the news, a tip bar, navigation to different applications, and more.
      Bing has a similar search result layout to Google, it presented me with many different hyperlinks and also has features to direct me to images and videos.
      Both engines provided me with similar and relevant information but I prefer Google over Bing. In my opinion, I like Google's cleaner interface since it best fits my needs for school and personal use.
      Looking at both search engines' global search market shares Google has a share of 84% and Bing has 3%, Google is currently leading the search engine market.</p>
