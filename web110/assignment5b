    <p>For assignment 5b I chose activity #1. This activity introduced internet services and what they are. Internet services enable users to access different kinds of information like text, graphics, sounds, and software.
Internet services are broken down into 4 different categories, communication services, information retrieval services, web services, and World Wide Web. Communication services allow users to share information with other users such as email, mailing lists, and instant messaging.
Information retrieval services allow users to look up things on the internet and receive information about it like File transfer protocol (FTP), Archie, and search engines. Web services let users exchange information with other applications on the internet.
The World Wide Web (WWW) allows users to access and navigate different information compiled throughout the internet. I use web services every day for school and personal use to search the internet for information that is relevant to me.</p>
