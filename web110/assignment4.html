    <p>The first activity I chose was activity #1. In this activity, I read about an overview of email basics. Email is a way to send and receive mail through the Internet. You send mail to people's unique email addresses that they create through an email service provider.
      There are many different email providers to choose from like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook being the biggest ones. An email interface consists of 3 things an inbox, the message pane, and the compose pane.
      The inbox stores all the emails you receive, selecting a specific email opens the message pane where you can read and respond to the email, and the compose pane creates a draft which you can then email.
      The second activity I chose was activity #2. For this activity, I had to send an email and reply to another. I had to send an email to my composition teacher so I opened the compose pane where I had to enter my professor's email address and then enter a subject for the subject line.
      I then drafted an email and sent it out. After I received a response I replied to the email by clicking on it in the inbox which opened the message pane and drafted my reply. Email is the best way to send private messages instantly on the internet.
      Personally, email is very important for me since I almost use it every day to communicate for school-related purposes.</p>
