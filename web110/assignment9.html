    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>
    <p style="color:red;">For lesson 9 playing around with CSS was a bit of work. I learned about the different ways to insert CSS into my website like with external, internal, and incline style sheets.
      Inside these style sheets, I was able to insert different properties like color, text size, font, and more depending on what I wanted my site to have. Overall I enjoyed using CSS and would like to continue to learn more about it.</p>
