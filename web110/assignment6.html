    <p>For session 6, I chose activities 1 and 2. Activity 1 introduced me to different network fundamentals like reference models, protocols, and domain name systems. Reference models are standardized network models that are built to be compatible with various network devices.
      Internet Protocols are responsible for sending packets of data across the internet. There are many different internet protocols that each serve a specific function such as TCP, IP, UDP, FTP, TFTP, and HTTP. Internet domain name system or DNS converts domain/host names into an IP address.
      DNS is important because without it, internet traffic increases when downloading data packets. For Activity 2 I had to review my local network IP address settings. My computer is connected to my local network through ethernet.
      Looking at my network settings I was able to see that I'm by default using DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol which automatically provides me, the IP host an IP address when using my network. Next, I opened my command prompt and typed in ipconfig which showed me my IP configurations through ethernet.
      It listed all of my network's DNS IPs like IPv4, Subnet Mask, and the Default gateway. The IPv4 IP address is my network's local IP. These activities showed me the basics of networking. I can apply these concepts to my environment when trying to diagnose a network problem in or outside my home.</p>
