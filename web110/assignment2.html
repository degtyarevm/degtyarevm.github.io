    <p>The first activity I did was Activity #1. This activity had me go over what a web browser is and some basic internet tips. 
      What I learned from this activity is that a web browser is software that helps you search the internet. 
      There are many different types of browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and more. 
      These browsers have many different features specific to them and you can choose the one that best fits your liking. 
      With these browsers, you can access web pages by URL. A URL is a specific address for a webpage. Most web pages contain hyperlinks that can open other web pages. 
      As I mentioned earlier browsers have many different features but the most common throughout all of them is the ability to favorite web pages for future use, 
      save web page elements like images to your computer, and install browser plug-ins that are other software that allow you to view different types of content. 
      The second activity I did was Activity #2. This activity had me install different web browsers and compare them. The browsers I compared were Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. 
      Chrome's browser has a simplistic look to it but offers many different customization opportunities like changing background themes and installing different plug-ins. 
      It also includes a password manager and web page safety checks. Chrome makes browsing fast since it's built for performance and saving energy. 
      Chrome offers many different features and customization for its users. Edge's browser on the other hand caters to everyone from gamers to businesses. 
      When opening Edge it has everything you need on its browser such as the news, hyperlinks to various other web pages of your choosing, and pre-loaded plug-ins. 
      Edge also offers many different features of its own like Cortana, Microsoft Office, and its integration with the operating system Windows. 
      It also has security and privacy features that help protect you while browsing. With the same technology, Chrome uses Edge over performance for its users. 
      In my opinion, I like Google Chrome better because of its fast loading speeds, simplistic look, and its various plug-ins. 
      These features help me navigate through the internet especially when I'm completing school work and just browsing the internet during my free time.</p>
